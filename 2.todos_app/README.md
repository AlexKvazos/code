# TODOs App

A simple TODO list app has been provided. You will have to make sure the app is meeting the expected behavior, doing the necessary fixes.

Expected behavior:

- At startup, display the list of the first 10 TODOs.
- Allow the user to add a new TODO. The addition should only be done in the UI, not in the remote API.
- Clear the input text after adding a new TODO.

Keep in mind:

- You can add, modify or remove code if you think is needed.
- You can install additional Node Packages if you think is appropriate.
- For this exercise `serviceWorker.js` wasn't modified, you can skip it from verification
- Unit testing wasn't modified either.
