# Employees list
A simple Employee list app has been provided, for this exercise your expertise is required to optimize, organize and standardize the code based on the best practices you may know, you will also need to debug it in order to make it run without errors, remember to check UX (User eXperience) to be sure everything is working as expected.

Expected behavior:

- Display a list of users
- Display avatar image in list
- Have a link in the name that will open a Modal with the same information
- Be able to close the modal box with Esc, X button and Close button

Keep in mind:

- You can add or remove code if you think is appropriate
- You can install additional Node Packages if you think is appropriate.
- For this exercise `serviceWorker.js` wasn't modified, you can skip it from verification
- Unit testing wasn't modified either, for unit test better check **Unit Testing** exercise.
