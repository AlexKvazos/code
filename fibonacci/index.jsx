/**
 * Instructions:
 * 
 * Write a program that will print the first 20 numbers of the fibonacci series
 * print the result in a new React page and add it to the navigation bar of the App
 * add an input element to the page and configure it to do at least 1 of the 2 following options
 * 
 * 1. Test if the input's value is part of the series, must allow any number.
 * 
 * 2. Get the Nth number of the series where "Nth" is the input's value, must allow any number.
 * 
 * Both options must allow any number, not only the 20 printed above.
 * 
 * What is Fibonacci Sequence:
 * In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fn, form a sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.
 * Example: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ...
 * 
 * Every number in the sequence could be represented by the following:
 * F0 = 0
 * F1 = 1
 * F2 = F0 + F1
 * Fn = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
