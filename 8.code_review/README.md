# Code Review

Code review is the act of consciously and systematically convening with one's fellow programmers to check each other's code for mistakes.

Duplicate the file and make the code review in GitHub, anything you see fit, mistakes or blocks that can be improved please comment, and don't be afraid to add as many relevant comments as you see fit.
